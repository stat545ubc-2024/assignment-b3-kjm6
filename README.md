## App Description
This app was created to detail data regarding opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States from 1999-2016. In the app, there are two tabs.

### Graphing Tab
In this tab, you can filter and group data by demographic. The output produced is a combined bar chart/line plot with the line denoting total annual deaths, and the barchart representing the demographic makeup of those deaths. 

### Table Tab
In this tab, you can filter data by state. After filtering, you can export your new table into a CSV for download.

## Data Source
This data was originally collected from the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) website at this link: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Drug-Poisoning-Mortality-by-State-United-Stat/xbxb-epbu/about_data
